                        <p class="content-p3 cwhite2">We were searching for tools and platforms to showcase our capability, talent & creativity. In midway, we got to know about web development. We started researching how to start it and be a professional at it. That course of time
                            has made us learned things like time management, reaching our daily goals, troubleshooting problems. Those days had a great impact on our perspective of life.

                        <p class="content-p3 cwhite2">We are a team of three; we were learning the things accurately and planning to execute them. We had set a goal of doing an individual project every two weeks. Then we started doing our first test project i.e Tribute page to people
                            we admire a lot. That was a big challenge for us as beginners.

                            Nirvan: “Especially me who wanted to be professional at all things, wanted to beat those two, at last, I was two days late and not that good but was an average. I was happy that I was able to do something. In the mid, while doing the project I lost interest
                            and almost gave up myself but the constant push was the jealousy that the other two were able to do why you weren't, that was my inspiration to complete that project. At last, I was late but actually, I am glad that I completed
                            it without fail.”

                            Varun: "Initially, I have not thought of web development and web designing. But later on,I have learned something. My first breakthrough was when we decided to create a tribute page. Then I decided to do a tribute page to SACHIN TENDULKAR. Though, it didn't look fresh.
                             I am proud of doing it. Because I was learning & implementing new things. Last but not the least I thank my friends for everything.
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-p3 cwhite2">From all these moments we have learned a lot and understood things better. We have been sorting all our mistakes and making ourselves the best versions... We are always proud of being one mile ahead…
